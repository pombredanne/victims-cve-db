title: "trustRoot not respected in HTTP client"
description: >
    When specifying the trustRoot (CA store) for the HTTP client, Twisted
    did not respect the user's specification, and always used the default
    of the platform trust. This means that users attempting to use this
    feature to implement certificate pinning, or otherwise restrict the
    trust CAs would still have accepted any certificate signed by a CA.
