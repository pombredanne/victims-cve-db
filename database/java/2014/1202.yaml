title: "SoapUI: remote code execution when processing WSDL"
description: >
    It was found that SoapUI would expand properties in WSDL files. A remote attacker, able to supply a WSDL file that would be processed by SoapUI, could supply arbitrary Groovy code in the property of a WSDL element. This property would be expanded, and the Groovy code executed, when the SoapUI client processed the WSDL.
