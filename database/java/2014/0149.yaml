title: "JBoss Seam 2: XSS via improper XML sanitization"
description: >
    JBoss Seam response envelopes include unsanitized parameter and id names 
    provided in the request. This allows a request to inject arbitrary XML into 
    the response.  A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform reflected 
    cross-site scripting attacks, provided the JBoss Seam remoting application 
    does not apply any cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection.
