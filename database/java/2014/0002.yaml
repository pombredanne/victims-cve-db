title: "Apache Camel: Read arbitrary files"
description: >
    The Apache Camel XSLT component will resolve entities in XML messages when transforming 
    them using an xslt route. A remote attacker able to submit messages to an xslt route 
    could use this flaw to read files accessible to the running application server and 
    potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.
