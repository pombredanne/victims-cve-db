title: "JBoss RichFaces: remote denial of service via memory exhaustion"
description: >
    It was found that certain malformed requests caused RichFaces to leak 
    memory. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to send a 
    large number of malformed requests to a RichFaces application that uses the 
    Atmosphere framework, leading to a denial of service 
    (excessive memory consumption) on the application server.
