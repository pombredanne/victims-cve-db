title: "Apache Camel: External method call in XSL stylesheets"
description: >
    The Apache Camel XSLT component allows XSL stylesheets to perform calls to external 
    Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to an xslt Camel route could 
    use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code execution in the context of the Camel 
    server process.
