title: "Stored XSS in business process editor"
description: >
    JBoss BRMS 6 and BPM Suite 6 are vulnerable to a stored XSS via business process editor. The flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-5398. Remote, authenticated attackers that have privileges to create business processes can store scripts in them, which are not properly sanitized before showing to other users, including admins.
