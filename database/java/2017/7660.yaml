title: "Security Vulnerability in secure inter-node communication in Apache Solr"
description: >
    Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted node name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which does not implement either HttpClientInterceptorPlugin or HttpClientBuilderPlugin, his/her servers are vulnerable to this attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those who use Kerberos are not affected
