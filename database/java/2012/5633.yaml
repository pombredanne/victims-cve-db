title: "jbossws-cxf, apache-cxf: Bypass of security constraints on WS endpoints when using WSS4JInInterceptor"
description: >
    If web services are deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor 
    enabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these services 
    will always be granted access, without applying authentication checks. The 
    URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing REST-like access 
    (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote attacker could use this 
    flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple SOAP service using GET 
    requests that bypass the security constraints applied by WSS4JInInterceptor. 
    This flaw is only exploitable if WSS4JInInterceptor is used to apply 
    WS-Security processing. Services that use WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security 
    are not affected.
