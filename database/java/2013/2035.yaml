title: "HawtJNI: predictable temporary file name leading to local arbitrary code execution"
description: >
    "The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name 
    in /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom 
    library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native 
    libraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI 
    writes them, and when they are executed."
