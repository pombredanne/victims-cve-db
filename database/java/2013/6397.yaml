title: "Apache Solr: directory traversal when loading XSL stylesheets and Velocity templates"
description: >
    "It was found that the SolrResourceLoader class in Apache Solr allowed 
    loading of resources via absolute paths, or relative paths which were not 
    sanitized for directory traversal. Some Solr components expose REST 
    interfaces which load resources (XSL stylesheets and Velocity templates) via 
    SolrResourceLoader, using paths identified by REST parameters. A remote 
    attacker could use this flaw to load arbitrary local files on the server via 
    SolrResourceLoader, potentially resulting in information disclosure or 
    remote code execution."
