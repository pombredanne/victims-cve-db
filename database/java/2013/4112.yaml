title: "JGroups: Authentication via cached credentials"
description: >
    "A flaw was found in JGroup's DiagnosticsHandler that allowed an attacker on
    an adjacent network to reuse the credentials from a previous successful 
    authentication. This could be exploited to read diagnostic information (
    information disclosure) and attain limited remote code execution."
